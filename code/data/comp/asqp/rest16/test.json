Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice!

The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery.

Being that this is always my order, I've come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate (unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn't taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. I know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don't have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won't know, but we definitely won't be back here!

It's actually quite perfect. The reason why I wouldn't even give this place any stars is because of the customer service. Wow. I've had never been to a place with such terrible service. I mean, I'm not expecting full-fledged, strenuous service or anything, but I mean, can I get at least a smile!? I would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite. And they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper.

We had 24\" sections that the salesperson filled with 21\" cabinets and a 3\" spacer which look VERY odd. In addition, the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don't look quite right. instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store, we were left to figure it out after the fact. And we could have come up with some pretty simple, probably no cost -difference solutions. The sales staff are friendly, but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible. Second, they do not call back. If they say they will call you, or schedule a delivery, be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will. It will be a one-way street of communication. Guaranteed. I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday, but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening. Follow up call on Monday, and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work. Follow up call on Tuesday, same promise. Follow up call on Wednesday, and the delivery person is bringing it. Delivery person shows up Thursday, saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning. You are paying for cabinets in a flat-packed box. You get no information, no customer service, no call-backs, etc. Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised, and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive (a week? 6?). If schedule and customer service are important to you (and they should be!), this is probably not your first choice. And I agree with other reviews. The cabinets are nice, but the price is not lower than other options. Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around, not a cheaper option. We are happy with our kitchen, but it was painful.",

The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle. That wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either. So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive. Channing was perfect. He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him. Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests. And the photos! Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning. He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration. He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives. During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over. We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle. It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs. Seeing his site (http://www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review. We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well. During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos. We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled. Finally, working with Channing is a joy. He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does. He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way. Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery. So yes, Channing is a ninja. He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.",

        "full_review": "Channing is a photo ninja. My parents told me a horror story about their friends' wedding photographer, who insisted on always getting the shot he wanted. The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle. That wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either. So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive. Channing was perfect. He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him. Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests. And the photos! Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning. He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration. He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives. During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over. We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle. It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs. Seeing his site (http://www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review. We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well. During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos. We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled. Finally, working with Channing is a joy. He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does. He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way. Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery. So yes, Channing is a ninja. He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.",

But the tap room downstairs had plenty of seating, and quick dual-bartender service. Some nice things to note about the tap room: 1) you can enter from the back of the restaurant where most people park, 2) if you are a smoker you can pop in and out, 3) there is plenty of bench seating for large groups, 4) this floor has it's own restrooms (clean ones), 5) you can request a table for dinner, and then hang out in the tap room until the table is available. It got a little noisy in there, but only after they started to fill up. The room is really large, and had nice lighting (and clean tables). The drinks weren't too bad. It was a strange selection for as many beers as they had. I am an IPA fan myself, but with the 20 some beers on tap, there was one IPA, and one Imperial IPA. I did a beer flight of 5 beers for $12.50. I have had cheaper flights! When I couldn't decide on a fifth beer I asked the bartender to give me a wildcard and surprise me and she gave me a \"Bucharaht\" (sp?). To me, it tasted a bit like bacon. I passed it around the table, and everyone agreed it had a nice smoked flavor. I ended up having to order a full beer of it. The bartender was not the friendliest I have ever had, hence not a five star in my book. You expect a little more personality, I guess. But I got beer, relatively fast, and was able to cash out after every order (not knowing how long we would stay). I noticed parking was a pain. We were staying in town and went on foot. I would suggest parking somewhere central and hoofing it. We also made use of Uber which worked in our favor for the night.",

They were out already (of course), but gave me a \"Firearms Request Form\" and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock. A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks. Two weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabela's. So I start a series of polite calls to the store. And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with \"Jay\", who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00. After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s). Needless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call. Apparently once I left the store with that \"Firearms Request Form\", my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela's trash can. Or so I surmise, because Cabela's REALLY didn't seem to want my $370. Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess. So I took my business to one of Cabela's local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didn't have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela's. I do hope someone at Cabela's sees this review, and finds out why a customer can't receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all. Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back. Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabela's, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service. Going forward I think I'll take a pass on Cabela's. And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabela's you may or may not get it. Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache.",

The food and service though have been completely average to disappointing on my last couple of visits. I was just there a few nights ago with a party of 7, the waiter, who is Italian and speaks English with a very heavy accent (and therefore hard to understand at times) was rude and aggressive. He talked over people when they asked questions about the menu and wasn't helpful with any answers, someone asked about the clam pasta entree and he said \"it's clams and spaghetti\"... it was awkward. He didn't suggest or ask if anyone wanted wine or drinks so we had to ask for them, he didn't ask if anyone wanted coffee or dessert so we had to ask for both. The service was slow, we were there over 3 hours. Two people at the table ordered the clam pasta and both thought it was completely bland, the other entrees were fine but not fantastic.",

They were out already (of course), but gave me a \"Firearms Request Form\" and said that would lock in the sale price once the Walther was back in stock. A gentleman named Ted assured me I would be called back within two weeks. Two weeks pass, and not a peep from Cabela's. So I start a series of polite calls to the store. And only after two or three calls with no one being able to help me, I learned I needed to speak with \"Jay\", who apparently only works from 9:00-12:00 and 1:-3:00. After a few more phone calls I was never able to reach him during these times, but over a week-long period I did leave two voicemails (again, very polite) asking Jay to please return my message(s). Needless to say, neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call. Apparently once I left the store with that \"Firearms Request Form\", my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela's trash can. Or so I surmise, because Cabela's REALLY didn't seem to want my $370. Asking them to take 30 seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask, I guess. So I took my business to one of Cabela's local competitors, where I paid $20 more but didn't have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela's. I do hope someone at Cabela's sees this review, and finds out why a customer can't receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all. Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back. Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big-box retailers like Cabela's, and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service. Going forward I think I'll take a pass on Cabela's. And for everyone else, be advised, if you ever need customer service from Cabela's you may or may not get it. Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache.",

It's actually quite perfect. The reason why I wouldn't even give this place any stars is because of the customer service. Wow. I've had never been to a place with such terrible service. I mean, I'm not expecting full-fledged, strenuous service or anything, but I mean, can I get at least a smile!? I would order my sandwich, and they would already be choosing my bread for me. I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread (I wasn't paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn't help but watch in disgust). I corrected her and she looked at me, scoffed, rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested. SO dramatic. Another occasion, I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted -- but after her putting the ham, the cheese, she added lettuce without my saying. I told her I wanted it toasted and she said, \"too late.\" I have umpteen many affairs with them, but the general point is the service is terrible. They are slow, rude and do NOT listen. It's awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their \"personalized sandwiches\" and you get the complete opposite. And they don't close the sandwich when they're done with it, instead, they just wrap it up. You know what that means, right? The sauce of your choice isn't in the sandwich, it's in the paper.

More importantly, the flavors are very hard to detect. I've had their green tea and pink lemonade flavors. The green tea cupcake's flavor was so mild I needed to work to try and find the hint of green tea in it. The pink lemonade was so sweet and icing heavy, I could barely taste the cherry. It was the unappealing texture, however, that bothered me the most. Their cupcakes are dry and heavy. The green tea cupcake I purchased actually appeared to be unevenly baked, with the bottom half looking undercooked. The pink lemonade cake was hard and dry.

Went back to room and \"clean\" sheets then had blood or feces on them. I was so disgusted I should have slept in my car. Instead I took the one clean top sheet and slept on top of that. All the hallways reek of cigarette smoke! The rooms were non smoking yet had ashtrays! The next morning I'm getting dressed and see blood or feces or something smeared on the wall by bathroom! Will never ever stay here again. The night front desk agent was nice but morning front desk was extremely rude!

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. I would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.",

When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back.

The space is beautiful. TOO beautiful to be giving out free things, what did we do to deserve this? If you were giving me free stuff out of a dark shack I would still take it happily. My understanding is that you can rent the space, which would be great for an intimate something or other, it has a very PNW vibe. Employees are friendly and helpful. The Sampling Lab doesn't have a ton of stock as of late. It's hard to keep free stuff on the shelves I would imagine. It is literally next door to my gym so I can peek in if I see something that catches me eye. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if your in the area it's worth stopping by.",

So much tender, juicy meat! I'd drive out of my way out to the Couve, to order either of these entrees again. The one glaring omission in Val's business model is the lack of accessibility. She's only open a few hours a day. True, she's built a booming business with legions of adoring fans and in all likelihood simply doesn't need to hire more staff to stay open later. The problem being, there's a vast cross-section of potential and acutal fans of Val's that work swing or graves that are largely, effectively cut off from having access, and this little diner is a place that deserves plenty of exposure to the masses. Should Val ever consider later hours (esp on weekned nights), that'll be just the bump needed for instant 5 star accolades. If Stepping Stone can do it, you most definitely can dooo it. Val and co: you're a shining star, no matter who you are. Shining bright to see, what you could truly be...",

They 'loved' the food, a direct positive sentiment about food quality, they affirm the 'huge' portions which is a positive statement about the style/options of the food, and they state that the overall value is 'very good', indicating a positive sentiment about restaurant prices. The choice of codeword (i.e., 'overall') in option B is slightly misleading because the sentiment is about the value rather than price alone. Option C incorrectly includes 'overall value' as the aspect term and considers it related to food prices specifically, which isn't quite accurate in this context. Finally, option D omits the term 'overall' which isn't essential in this case as the sentiment is clearly understood without it.\",\n \"1. Best Choice\": \"A\",\n \"1. Confidence\": \"5\",\n \"2.

Additionally, the reviewer expresses positive opinions about the service, describing it as 'warm and personable'. The best choice must reflect these two positive sentiments.

Since the primary sentiment is the reviewer's positive opinion on the food ('entrees') and willingness to travel for it, option D is incorrect as 'Couve' is wrongly associated with 'RESTAURANT#GENERAL'. Option B properly reflects the positive sentiment towards the entrees and also captures the miscellaneous aspect related to the location 'Couve'. Option C is incorrect because it combines the aspect about driving with the entrees, which is not accurate because the positive sentiment about driving is related to the willingness to travel, not the food quality directly.\",\n \"4.

And this restaurant is base of Mt. Everest in the small town of Anandapur. This place serves Asian fusion ( Combines flavor from China, India and Nepal) My fiancé, our godson and I had a wonderful meal there at Yak and Yeti Restaurant. We started with Wok-Fried green beans, House Salad, and Thai Chili Chicken Wings as our appetizers. These dishes were so wonderful. Then we had Combo (shrimp and Chicken) Lo Mein , sautéed egg noodles, carrots, cabbage, green onions and bean sprouts for our main dish. I would say, we really loved the food and this place. We got a really nice service as well. Too bad, this place is too far a way from me to visit often. Otherwise I will be a big fan.

In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. Tried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was!

Tilapia and avocado, an excellent taco even with with Quality Seafood's offerings looming just down the street. - The Pineapple Pork. Pork carnitas and pineapple with scallions, also pretty good. - The Kim Lee BBQ. Korean BBQ pork with kimchi and scallions, on 2 toasted Hawaiian sweet rolls. This was amazing, a perfect blend of sweetness from the rolls and savory from everything else. It was like the ultimate stoner food (not a bad consideration keeping in mind the neighborhood around it, especially considering that they apparently deliver nearby until 10pm most nights. Hmm....). Most tacos are $3.75, with the exception of the larger items like the Kim Lee, which is $5.75 and deserves every penny of its price tag. This trailer seems to prefer corn tortillas for the tacos, which is fine with me. Next time I'll probably check out the Mexican Bun Dog, which puts sausage and bacon on the Hawaiian sweet rolls, and sounds too good to pass up.",

I was SO WRONG. Bombay Bistro's lunch buffet was Indian buffet heaven! There wasn't a dud dish on the line. The spices were just right, the soups were tasty, and the naan was wonderful. I was almost shocked it was so good. Definitely could be some of the best Indian in Travis County. Why didn't they get five stars? Tea service at the table was slow (my glass was empty more than full) and I did not like the dessert they had out. Pretty picky, but I'm picky like that. I need more tea! The line for the buffet was constant too. They have it up against a wall, and while there's an obvious flow, you feel slightly obliged to stand in line, waiting for everyone in front of you to shuffle through.

The kabobs were cooked to perfection and the portions are very large. Before you dine, sign up for the Taverna Opa V.I.P. card and they will provide a free cold appetizer.

I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service. I hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. Tried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! Overall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!",

From there, it went further downhill...My legal name is William, but I everyone usually knows that Bill is short for or a nickname for William...like Joe for Joseph, or Bob for Robert, Dick for Richard, etc. Well, they wouldn't accept my Visa card because my license shows William and my cc shows Bill. In all my years, I have never had an issue of my card getting rejected...and I mean never!! I asked to speak with the manager and offered to even call my credit card company...this guy didn't have a clue, nor did he care one bit. I then pulled out my AMEX, which did have William listed, but the bartender then stated they don't even take AMEX. After all that, I just ended up paying cash, but this was in my mind terrible customer service!

As we were ordering our pie and a grilled turkey sandwich, a short blond waitress asked if we were dinning in or taking out because, \"we are closing in 30 minutes!\". We said dinning in please and added with a smile we will be fast. The rude part is she wasn't even the person taking our order a gentleman was. She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving. We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich? The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. I am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out.

But we like sushi so we ate at the 8-seat sushi bar. Ordered the chef's special roll, \"made with the freshest ingredients\" which they said included lump crab and avocado. Except it was actually krab, which by no definition is \"fresh.\" It was late so the place had slowed down quite a bit from the early evening rush. So you'd think the wait staff had a little time to actually wait on you. Nope. Had to go find chop sticks. Had to wave down passing personnel to get drink refills. Second restaurant we've eaten at during our 8-day stay here and again ... the wait staff. Maybe it was just our one wait person, who seemed angry to even be there. Because some of the others seemed cheery and capable from afar. I know you're saying 'It's a hotel restaurant in a tourist trap town, what do you expect?' I expect not to be misled by the menu.

        "full_review": "It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together. Our destination of choice? Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill. Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards. Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out. We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening. Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\". She took our order and left. Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient. Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly. But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable. We hit a home run with our appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. My miso soup was excellent. For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll. Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston. It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi. With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality. We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile. However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come. We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against it as he tried to cut into it. I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back. We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare. We left disappointed. The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied. I doubt we'll go back.",

        "full_review": "Pijiu belly is new restaurant in Westside that had its soft opening last Tuesday(12/09/2014). They call themselves a pub fare restaurant with Asian influence. I had a chance to try their food for lunch. Pijiu means beer - I am not sure they named the restaurant beer belly or the belly is a reference to pork belly in their menu. Regardless, it's always nice to see new restaurants. The restaurant is located on left, if you are driving from GA tech campus and 85, on 10th street, past north avenue and right across the street from sherwin Williams store. The parking is in a lot, right next to the restaurant. Currently it's a self park, but I hear it's going to valet parking in the future. The lot will fill up to 18 cars but they also have another lot up the street. When you enter you will see the prominent bar with granite counter, bar stools and TVs. On the left there is small area for dart boards and pool tables(not complete yet but I was told that the plan). There are several high bar tables on the right side area with 6 seating each and regular tables with 4 seating in the back, behind the bar. It has a modern-industrial style. The menu is rather simple for now - but they will have a revised menu with more items during their grand opening in January. It has charcuterie plates, starters, burgers and sandwiches, sides and beverages. And of course they have beer menu on the board as well. Taking about beer, they don't have beer on tap installed yet but I was told that it will be ready by end of the week with large selections. From charcuterie selection, I ordered la cabana - soft goat milk cheese made in Spain with rosemary crust. I liked the cheese but it wasn't as soft as I expected it to be. I also ordered, spicy soppressata - Italian made spicy pork cured meat and it was delicious. The plate was served with strawberry jam, pineapple chutney, Dijon mustard and balsamic reduction.($4 each and $11 for three). I also ordered, 'The Pijiu burger' based on recommendation from the bartender. It had fried egg, kimchi, cheese, beer-bbq sauce on brioche bread and served with hand-cut fries, onion, tomato and pickles. ($13) The burger had complex flavors and tasty, thanks to the runny egg yolk, kimchi, onion and beer-bbq sauce. It all works well together. My only gripe is that kimchi was quite oversalted for my taste and it kind of takes away the experience a bit. I liked it overall but would have loved it if they had salted kimchi just right. Strangely, there was no salt at all in the pickles and it was spicy!! I mean, I am ok with that but some of my friends who are hardcore pickle lovers would have problem with no salt pickles. The hand-cut fries was perfect though - neither too thin, nor thick. So it was nice and crunchy outside and moist inside. Overall, I like what I see. Yes, they are still setting things up. Currently there is lot of empty spaces, beer on tap missing and so on. But that's what the soft opening is for - to get feedbacks and make sure everything right before grand opening.",
