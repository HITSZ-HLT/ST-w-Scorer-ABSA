I LOVED the portion size; I'm pretty small and I always struggle finishing the food on my plate. It was such a phenomenal meal.

(You might peruse that previous review first for context.) We had a lengthy phone conversation, specifically about White Tuna - which is an endangered species and, as you'll read in my previous review, was an offending dish during our visit. Chuck invited me back for an on-the-house meal, and I got to spend time with an incredibly dedicated restaurant owner who is committed to this city and excellence in foodieism. (On the day I visited, he had accepted the award from Creative Loafing for the city's best sushi.) The Lobster Roll, which is one I had during my return visit, is a must. We had a smattering of other tasty nibbles, including the spicy tuna (great) - but the lobster roll was most certainly the stand-out. Chuck also connected me with a source in New Orleans to interview for a blog post. So, not only was I re-enchanted with a local restaurant I had previously loved - I made a new friend in the process. Support this joint, because Steel opened and survived during the 2008 downturn and is still one of the nicest eating environments in midtown.",

The service is decent, the waitresses are friendly but don't pay much attention to the customers. But what they lack in service they make up in flavor! I ordered a 2 egg Benedict on regular English muffin with mushroom and white cheddar cheese and split with my friend who ordered hers with ham and the hollandaise sauce. The eggs were a tad over poached for my liking; the yolk was barely runny. But as a whole the dish worked perfectly. The muffin was toasted to crunchy perfection and the mushrooms provided a lovely bed for the egg, topped with sharp white cheddar. But, by far the best dish we ordered was the lemon truffle hash! The truffle oil flavored the potatoes magically with just a hint of the lemon. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the mood for a nice brunch.

I'm glad i did not listen to my inner scepticism because I love this little place. The first thing you will notice is the size, it's a small pub where the bar alone takes up half of space with some nice cozy booths in the back. You will feel comfortable as you are, with or without your snuggie. The food was a cut above your normal pub menu, those little mini yourkies are the size of mini cupcakes are delicious. The Irish nachos and roast beef sandwich are also very tasty, add these together with some beer and it's a match made in heaven.

The location is pretty nice. Brookline is very nice and fancy and despite not having a parking lot, there was a good amount of street parking to spare. The actually restaurant was small. Very small. I was quite surprised how small it was really. But when everyone spread out to all the available tables, there was enough room for you to make your delicious sushi creations. This is only an exception for this particular class, but because there was a party that reserved the time spot after our class. Our class ended up being extremely over booked. It says online that the maximum is about 12 people. I think we had about 23. So this very small room because CRAMPED. I went with my boyfriend an another couple. And we had to wait a while to get to the bar in order to get out ingredients. Then we were stuck in a spot behind the counter, in the corner without a knife to cut our sushi. There were a lot of ingredients. Crab, cucumber, spicy tuna, salmon, smoked salmon, regular tuna. It was a lot to work with, which was a lot of fun. I don't know much about Sushi though, so I was always wondering 'will this taste good together??' So I wish they gave out a paper wither what some sushi has in it to mimic. We ended up making about 4 rolls each because we were the only people not able to cut our Sushi and eat it like all the others. The teacher was VERY nice and funny and I'm not sure if it was his wife that was helping or not, but she was very nice and fun too. We took the C1 beginner's class and in the beginning we were given a sheet on how to make the perfect rice, which was really helpful and answered a good amount of questions. All in all. I'd really like to go back and take a more accelerated course and just hope that the class isn't over booked that time.",

I know that it's a bar and caters to a nighttime crowd, but we were there at noon, and they were open, so I expected them to actually be prepared for a day time crowd. I was there with my mom and my 3 kids, and ordered sprites for the kids - the waitress brought 3 very full paper cups without lids, and said they didn't have lids. Okay, that's fine, but how about you fill them halfway up? Or ask me before you bring them? So my kids spilled Sprite all over themselves. Then it took her forever to come back to get our food order. We ordered, finally, and the food took forever. It seems like the wait-staff was way more excited about serving the patio than the folks inside, since that's where they seemed to spend most of their time. When the food finally came, it was delicious. I couldn't finish my sandwich, and waited and waited and WAITED for the waitress to come so I could ask for a togo box. We also wanted to order dessert donuts. She basically never came, so I got up and asked the bartender for the boxes and our check. That, too, took forever, and then once we had the check and pulled out credit cards to pay, it took the waitress forever to come back and take the card, then took her forever to swipe it and bring it back. I would very much like to return in the evening and hope for a better experience but perhaps the management (who walked past our table repeatedly and ignored us) should spend some time training the waitstaff that flirting with hot guys at the bar isn't what they're paid for.",

Pilates gives me a different kind of weight training experience and has helped me keep my volleyball skills sharp as I get older. It also helps to reduce my back twinges and reduce, more importantly, the size of my stomach. They really do have some of the best instructors in the city and I've enjoyed everyone whose class I've taken. They know their stuff and really do a great job of pinpointing my individual issues and isolating the movements so I can't cheat my way through a workout by using my stronger shoulders as opposed to my weaker abs. If anything, I feel a bit like an outlier because I'm one of the few guys who takes classes there (which could be a positive or negative for you). It would be nice if the changing room was more than just a camouflaged utility closet, but it's better than nothing, I guess. The staff does a nice job with customer service as well, but sometimes last minute changes can be difficult. Overall, I have no problem recommending this place for anyone who's looking for a great Pilates workout!",

Option C adds unnecessary detail by including 'money or time', which makes it less concise than necessary. Therefore, D is the correct choice.\", \"4. Best Choice\": \"D\", \"4.

I went with a friend who also had Cuban food in Miami before and also had high expectations. As I walked in, I saw (and heard!) a big group of Cuban people having lunch there (if Cubans eat there, that's a good sign!). The people there were friendly and we got sat down right away. I was very happy with the menu and was happy to find many of my favorites in there (tostones, yuca frita, ropa vieja, vaca drita, palomilla, cubano, etc). I went ahead and ordered yuca frita as an appetizer and ropa vieja with congris (arroz moro) and maduros. I was disappointed that the yuca frita came with refried beans type of sauce instead of cilantro garlic sauce, like it does in many Cuban restaurants. The yuca fritas were too fried, too hard. The ropa vieja was good, although a little too hard. The congris did not have a lot of flavor but I was satisfied anyway. Overall, it was a good place. Close to what I would consider authentic from Miami. I will definitely come back because I am sure this is as authentic as it will ever get in a town with a very very small Cuban population.",

Cooked well and the mushroom gravy was delicious. I ordered it with a side of smashed potatoes and wow were they good. I tried the Sauerkraut and I wanted to like it, I just couldn't. Glad I tried it though. I went again tonight and I went with the buffet. I was not disappointed at all. Ever kind of sausage was so good, especially when adding the spicy mustard that was on the table. I had to get the smashed potatoes again. Their green beans are some of the best I have ever had. though I did notice that the green beans in the buffet were different than the green beens my mom received with her meal. Thought that was strange. Definitely recommend this place as a \"must go\" if you have never been there before. Plan on waiting a while if you go during dinner time, but still worth the wait. It is kind of on the pricier side (above 12 dollars a person. The buffet is $15 a person) They did have a live band start playing at 8:30 which made it really hard to talk to your table after that. Something I didn't really care for, but it may not bother everyone. Just a personal preference, so go earlier if you don't care for loud music. Still have yet to try their beer and will be going back to try that. Oh and I have had their peanut butter fudge cream puff each time I have went with coffee. If you don't care for trying their dinner. Do yourself a favor and at least go for coffee and dessert. Great coffee and an amazing cream puff!",

The halibut was pretty good with some type of zucchini cake/patty below. The tenderloin was tender, but a little dry. It was stuffed with bacon, carrots, and celery and served with grilled creamed corn, which was delicious. The polenta cake seemed out of place and did not really add to the dish other than a stomach filler. For dessert, we tried the flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream was icy and had chunks of salt in it, which I did not like. The cake was dense, a bit on the dry side, and kind of like a flattened brownie--I would not order it again. Service was a little slow even though we were 1 of 2 tables for the majority of our meal. There appeared to be only 1 waitress, but we did arrive in the 5 o'clock hour.

I understand the dishes are unique and it's not your average Indian place. The menu was great, had a hard time choosing what to get. Good selection of drinks. Quite dim inside, good fast service. I hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. Tried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! Overall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!",

Their hospitality was disappointing as we made reservations the night before for 8pm on a Tuesday and when we arrived the female server said our table wasn't ready and if we left and came back in 20 minutes she'd be able to push 2 small tables for our group of 4. She didn't seem apologetic at all. A male staff member then handled a group of 5 Caucasians that were behind us in line. The one guy in the group said he had called in reservations about an hour ago. They got seated right away at a table right in front of us. Wondered why we didn't get that table. We discussed the server's demeanor and whether to go elsewhere. The server said they would call us once a table was free so we left for drinks at Yagger. We went back to Cinara and there were several tables available, yet no one had called us back. In terms of food, standouts were the $8 Chicken Liver Parfait with cornichon, capers & garlic scapes, $17 Albacore Tuna Charred Broccoli, Black Olives & Smoked Tonnato, and $16 Beets, Foie Gras, Sunflower, Espelette & Red Wine Reduction. $33 Beef Short Rib, Farro, Toffee Shallots, Fiddleheads & Black garlic were a 4/5. $23 Duck and Anchovy Ragu, Lemon and Parsley was good. $4 House Bread and Butter, $19 Mixed Salami Plate and $23 Tagliatelle, Bolognese was okay but no different than anywhere else. $24 Nettle Risotto, Pecorino & Shaved Almonds was a 3 out of 5. Again, some tasty dishes but tiny portions. The noise was also slightly too loud to the point that you'd have to ask your neighbor to repeat themselves. We still had a great time despite the reservation issue and unthoughtful service. There were 2 dishes the server cleared without asking if we were done. They only had a bite or two on there but these are gourmet portions girl! That's like a third of the dish! Bill for 4 people that were still hungry after was $292.50 before tip.",

The item was labeled $26.99 on tje shelf. When I checked out my bill was $56.99. Money is not the option, however, when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product. I said no, and walked her to the shelf, where 3 more of the same item sat. While she checked on the correct price the line became 8 customers long. Only one checker was helping customers. At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf. I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location. He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store.

The restaurant is gay owned and operated, and definitely is a staple of gay Atlanta, so it is well worth mentioning. The food is pretty good (depending on what you get), and the service is always stellar. Some of those waiters have an attitude on them, but you just gotta snap those queens in their place! But seriously, it is all in good fun; I have never had a bad experience!! The beer is cheap, and all the martini's are $5. There is regularly trivia, and there is always some reason to stop by Joe's. During the warm months, it is very hard not to just say, \"why don't we meet at Joe's?\", because it is the place to be. Parking can be tricky, there is a very small parking lot, but there is usually a place down the street or across the road, for pay.

I liked that when you walk in not only is there a retail section of glasses and other things but there is a bar where you can do tastings. Also a bakery section in the back. It had potential. Waited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't bad. Our server was Heidi and she was nice. Not too attentive but very helpful. Ordered red sangria, friend got the sparkling wine flights and they were both OK. The sangria was too sugary.Nothing special which is crazy since they make their own wine and that's their thing. Maybe I'm just use to the bottle wines I like, who knows. Appetizer was Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps. They delicious. The amount of chicken was not enough for three people but it came with onion crunches, chopped cabbage mix and delicious cucumbers. For dinner I ordered the flatbread and salad combination, Carne Asada flatbread and Caesar pesto salad. The salad was really really good. I didn't really taste much pesto but it was faintly in the background which added so much flavor. The flatbread was perfect. The bottom was crunchy and the meat was very tender. My friend ordered the wild mushroom and chicken risotto. The risotto was very tasty. Got to try the ooey gooey butter cake and it was so good. Ha everything was so good ! I would love to come back and try more things. The lobster bisque soup was calling my name.",

They also take your items you are carrying and place it on the table in the front for you. Great way to keep your hands free and each section organized. The range of decor and fashion is really broad so there is truly something for everyone. Furniture, decor, clothes, jewelry, maps, lamps, shoes, wood, tin, glass, so much awesome stuff. My favorite were the abundance of wall decor, broach art, wood furniture and old windows and so many owls! I saw so many various pieces for myself as well as fabulous gift ideas for all sorts of occasions. I purchased two things for myself on this visit as well as two gifts.

The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. Third, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. fourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced.

You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger.

This is one of those places that has so much great stuff, and varying menus for brunch, lunch and dinner, that I just couldn't decide on when to come and what to get. I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people: - Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6) This is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread. - Sunrise Poutine ($15) I told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs. - Sunnyside Burger ($15) As if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese. - Southern Belle French Toast ($12) Another really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles. It's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service. It's a fun, energetic atmosphere though, which combined with all that delicious food makes you look past these slight flaws and yearn to return to try more great stuff.",

Thus, two distinct aspects are mentioned: the appealing look of the menu and the taste of the food. The mention of price in option C is irrelevant to the expressed sentiment and is thus not necessary for labeling.\",\n\"2.

Rationale\": \"The review mentions the Sunrise Poutine in a neutral context, stating that it was considered a 'starter'. There is no sentiment expressed towards the quality or style options of the poutine itself; instead, the mention is more about the customer’s choice on how they decided to categorize their meal. Therefore, this does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment toward the food or the food options.\",\n\"3. Best Choice\": \"No Sentiment or No Appropriate Option\",\n\"3. Confidence\": \"5\",\n\"4. Rationale\": \"This review expresses a clear, strong positive sentiment towards several aspects of the poutine. It praises the quality of the fries for remaining 'crispy', describes the eggs as 'good', the Canadian bacon as 'salty', and the fluffy eggs are described with superlative 'best'. This indicates a positive sentiment towards the quality of multiple individual food components. While option B also captures the positive sentiment, it splits the sentiment on the eggs into two parts ('good' and 'best'), which is unnecessary since the sentiment towards eggs is homogeneously positive. The labels in option C accurately capture the expressed positive sentiment towards the food's individual components using concise and appropriate aspect and opinion terms.\",\n\"4.

Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. fourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) The burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. Considering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable! finally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. All around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!! go Romer's!",

Its got the feel of a sports bar / pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. Second, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. Third, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles.

        "full_review": "I started looking for movers in early January and got kind of freaked out by how expensive, or shifty, or nonprofessional, or whatever that they all seemed to be. I called an old friend who had been in the moving business years ago and he said, \"You ever use Yelp?\" \"Duh,\" sez I. Practically living on Yelp, why didn't I think of that. So, my friend Lee goes on, \"Check them out. They have a million reviews and they still have 5 stars.\" He told me that he sends all his old customers there and he's heard no complaints. So I Yelped them and Lee was right. And if you know how to read Yelp, you know a shill review from a real review, and these were real reviews by real people. You also know that anyone with 99 reviews and a full 5 stars has to be doing something right, and they are. I called Jennifer and talked to her. She sounded intelligent and pleasant. I described the move and she said, \"you could go with 3, but I'd recommend 4 guys.\" I thought about it for a day, looked over the other cheesy estimates I'd gotten, and although Precision's estimate was much higher than the others, but I I suspected it to be more accurate. I decided to drive in to Somerville and see their facility and meet Jennifer. Finding it to be well established, clean and organized, I booked the job with Jen and picked up my $50 worth of free boxes. You get a lot of boxes for $50 at Precision. And they're good boxes; U-Haul quality good for a lot less per box. (BTW - do yourself a favor and stay away from Home Depot boxes. Flimsy, fall apart, and not at all rectangular. Whatever shape they do approximate is one where the flaps don't even come close to meeting when you try to seal them.) On moving day, my crew was Bo, Phil, Iztvan and Bella. They showed up promptly at 9AM, they looked strong and well rested, and immediately took a walk-through of the house. Bo told me right away \"We might not get this done today, but we'll try,\" and they launched right into moving me out of the top two floors of a 3 decker, and basement into temporary storage a couple hours away. And they flew through it. These guys worked their butts off. None of this \"2 guys will carry and 1 guy holds the door thing.\" Each guy moved things by himself that I could have sworn would take two guys. One guy moved a cube safe by himself! By himself, on his shoulder like it was a sack of flour! It was men in perpetual motion and they had filled the truck - to the top - by 1 'clock. And it was starting to snow... and it was forecast to snow hard. I was worried - a full truck meant that getting it all into the storage space would be iffy. They took less than 2 1/2 hours to get to the space. Having driven it before, I can tell you this: IF they stopped for lunch, it was to pick it up at a drive through and eat it on the road. They mooooved. At the other end... allow me to digress. Have you ever heard of the Theory of Nominative Determinism? It suggests that \"...a person's name is given an influential role in reflecting key attributes of his job, profession, or general life,\" like a guy named Larry Speakes will grow up to be a White House spokesman, and a girl named \"Eileen\" will limp? And then there's the aforementioned member of this moving squad, \"Phil.\" I guess the theory holds up for homonyms. These guys work as fast in reverse as they do forward. Three of them unloaded and Phil worked inside the space arranging, stacking, shifting, rearranging and re-stacking, filling every cubic centimeter of the unit. Absolutely amazing. Like backwards Jenga. It was after 6 PM and snowing hard - almost blizzard conditions and the stuff was piling up.- when they finished. They flat rated their return trip to Somerville at 2 hours. Maybe they made it in that time, but I'm pretty sure they saved me an hour or more on the back end. This move was expensive, don't get me wrong. But it did cost what Jennifer said it would cost, and it did cost what I had already figured it would cost. This crew took on a tough job with enthusiasm and good spirit and carried it through to the end. I could not rate any experience more highly than this. If Precision Movers were a barbecue, I would eat there weekly.",

Its got the feel of a sports bar / pub, but the look of a hip lounge. Its really smart and clean. I hate feeling smothered in a bar and Romers is open and inviting. Second, the staff is awesome. The servers wear casual jeans and a grey shirt, which I really appreciate. It makes me feel more comfortable. They are friendly but professional, attentive but fun. From the tables in the back, you can see the open kitchen and the staff back there seems to be having a blast, but taking it all very seriously. These are not just burgers to them, which I find very reassuring. Third, the drinks are great. Romer's went out of their way to get locally made beer that isn't god-awful granville island. They serve craft beer (small batches from micro-brews) on tap! I find that amazing. And for a GREAT price, less than $5 a pint. Half the beers I had never heard of, and I'm pretty keen on Vancouver's craft beers. There is also bottles. The cocktails are all doubles, and FRESH - I mean the watermelon juice tastes like it just got blended. The Sangria was the best I'd ever had, and the basil-lemonade is a MUST try (believe me, actually tastes AMAZING). Finally, a top notch wine list of, once again, mainly local bc wines. fourth, of course, is the FOOD. oh my word. the Appies are great, and reasonably priced. We had the cheese plate, a basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese, the olives/pickles plate, and edamame. YUM. That was for six of us by the way, not just me :) The burgers are literally to die for. The meat is all LOCAL and fresh which I can't describe how much I appreciate. The toppings range from your usual suspects, to really unique but delicious! You can also order your burger green, meaning it comes wedged between two big slabs of iceburg lettuce - AWESOME for those of us curbing carbs. But that being said, the buns are made in house and must be tried at least once! Burgers range from $9 to $14, just for the burger. Fries come at $3 - but its a whole basket that can feed 2 to 4 people easily. Considering its free-range, healthy meat - the price is unbeatable! finally, dessert! DONUTS made FRESH with different dips. OH MY. sooooooo good. All around, Romer's ROCKS. Its great whether you are watching a game, or out for a date. The burgers are far too big for small kids, but two kids could probably share one burger. They have a private room for groups. good music, good vibes, great times!! go Romer's!",
