Our server was easy going, also friendly, and helpful. The decor felt like a mix of retro and Asian influences. We were a party of four and had the cripsy spring rolls and braised pork belly buns, which were fun and tasty! We also had the dumplings (our favorite dish!), the chicken udon noodles that were a bit spicy but very good, and the chicken wings (good), plus sides of rice. The drinks (mine a Lotus Flower--delicious!) were creative and yummy. And then for dessert we had the coconut cream pie and the vanilla bean parfait, both of which we felt like we could have done without...neither wowed us. I would definitely return, since it was a fun environment with good food and decent prices, but some of the others in my group did not feel that way. All in all, a good place with good food!",

It looked beautiful. However it was not true to its name but mostly whipped cream with a caramel sticky center that made it impossible to cut neatly. Did not know about the weird caramel center until I cut into it. Would be nice if the website or employee provided a better description. It was a bit embarrassing trying to cut it in front of 30 people as it was a whipped creamy mess so it did not slice well and just flopped. It was not chocolaty at all. If you love whipped cream this is the cake for you. The name of the cake is very deceiving. The ricotta pie was pleasant, not great but not bad and not too sweet. No one commented good or bad but silent speaks louder than words. :/ Will not order this particular cake again. Overpriced at $52 for 12 inch.",

We filled up our plates with samplings from the buffet, from various salads (the potato salad was my favorite), rice and beans, and a gigantic french fry. The fun begins when the skewers of meat begin to arrive, ranging from chicken wrapped in bacon to pork ribs, chicken sausage, and top sirloin. There's a definite joy in grabbing the meat as it falls off from being cut and tasting as much as possible. Be sure to pace yourself; this place is extremely laid back, there's no card to flip over to tell them to bring meat and they'll keep serving you for as long as you'd like. A special bonus was the live music on Friday night -- a singer with a beautiful voice and a talented guitar player -- offering up traditional songs, as well as their gorgeous arrangements of pop songs like Rock with You, Come Away With Me, and Hotel California. Highlight of the evening was absolutely Tears in Heaven. There's ample parking behind the restaurant and it's located conveniently in downtown Everett. The value is tremendous here for the amount of succulent meat and I've paid four times as much for less of an experience. I will definitely be back.",

I did not get my water refilled. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, and it was rather tasty, but it was a 3\"x5\" slab on a plate with a light red sauce. No side pasta, no nice mozzarella topping. It looked like it went from the freezer to the plate. It tasted average. The decor was beautiful (+1 star). It feels like you're a cast member of the Godfather, minus the bullets. Would not go here again, not even for a biz lunch. I would rather go to Vinny T's! The manager (guy with the tie) even came over, and asked how everything was.

She came up from the side and interrupted mid order to inform us about closing in 30 minutes. We all felt uncomfortable and unwelcome. We even thought about leaving. We got our pie and had to wait until 9:50 for our sandwich. Before we even got our sandwich the woman got on the loud speaker to announce of the closing... we thought what about our sandwich? The sandwich was announced ready, a minute later. We were so worried about being done in 9 minutes we couldn't even enjoy our meal or experience. We wrapped our sandwich in a napkin and discarded our pie to get out in time. I am amazed with all the new pie restaurants popping up that this place can afford to kick people out.

We were looking for hard tacos and came upon Evita's Botanitas and the menu looked pretty great. So we GPS'd ourselves there and found ourselves in a small strip mall, nothing fancy. And the food did not disappoint!! First of all, the salsa they give you is above and beyond. They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire' I ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas! I don't care what they looked like, they tasted like heaven. Our waitress was really friendly and I would highly recommend eating here. I will make it a point to come back the next time I'm in town.",

I was attempting to pull in to the alley behind Taco Deli that I take to get to my parking lot at work and her giant red SUV was parked right in the middle of the one lane alley ( for her convenience of course. Never mind other people that could potentially need that alley clear to get to their place of business.) Since it's not advised to back up in to on coming, rush hour traffic, I was forced to wait for the sassy employee to come out and give me attitude for being inconvenienced by her. Not only did she sit in her car for a minute, she then drive as slow as possible for the 50 yards or so of alley. I then walked in to speak to a manager, who while clearly mortified, had no interest in making sure a very upset regular patron of Taco Deli's left feeling a little better about the business she was entrusted to manage. Not a shining day for this location at all. I officially work with in walking distance of my favorite taco joint. Breakfast? Yes! Lunch? Yes! Dinner? Nope. The only bummer is the early closing time and the fact that it is always packed. What else can I expect from a place that serves up deliciousness on the regular. This new job of mine came with the standard benefits and one seriously lucky location bonus. I'm a very happy girl these days.",

My husband and I shared the pick two cold appetizers (we chose babaganoush and hummus). It came out on a small saucer and contained maybe a 1/2 c of each for $10.75. I asked if it came with bread and they said no you have to pay for that separate so that was another $5 for the lavas bread (what was I suppose to eat with the dips). Then we split their house salad, which was priced at $10.75 (no protein added) and it was a basic sized salad with lettuce, some cous cous, 2 olives, some feta, tomato and cucumber.

However, for the main I got beef enchiladas with red salsa ( they were out of green salsa, along with half a dozen other menu items, but I'll chalk that up to opening weekend wrinkles to iron out). The red sauce was very dark and tasted bitter and burnt. The meat itself was good, although the tortilla was mushy and didn't really add anything. The rice was also overbooked and bland, and the refried beans could have been out of a can. The entire entree was a major disappointment.

It's much more convenient for me than trekking to Chinatown or Dorchester for pho, and there are so many tables, I've never had to wait in line. Their portions are quite generous and for under $10, you get a pretty tasty meal. For the pho, I always ask to get my eyeround beef raw on a separate plate rather than in the soup so that I can cook it myself, and it's awesome. I've done this over 20 times and have never gotten sick, so I do trust their meat. Their bun (vermicelli) dish is my favorite and I love the ones with meat and crispy rolls. There's lots of veggies on it and I devour the whole dish soaked with fish sauce. Their pork chops and catfish are both very good as well. The only bummer is that over the years, it seems they've started to skimp on the shrimp and pork spring rolls which I used to love. Since the portions are so big, I've stopped getting appetizers, although the shrimp toast and the quail were both tasty when I used to get them. The shakes take a while and aren't better than nearby competitors, so I usually stick with the coconut juice which they put baby coconut in. I generally go every few months and during the winter, maybe every few weeks. (On a side note, after visiting Vietnam and having pho there, I actually enjoy the pho here better for the flavor and generous toppings.) Don't expect it to be mindblowing. I just really enjoy how consistent, simple, and good it always is.",

After ordering at 6:30, the food came out in very separate waves starting at 7:30 so no one ate at the same time. My pizza never came out despite following up with the waitress each time we saw her (which was only about 4 times in the 3 hours). We finally chased down a manager to find our checks and she said she would do me a favor and remove the pizza. I pointed out I had never received a pizza and she told me I had. The entire interaction was baffling. It took about another half an hour to get a check for the one drink I had, which the manager then decided to comp. They did also offer a free play card, which I declined as I needed to leave and eat, and didn't care to ever return. I really wanted my 3 hours back more than the free drink or arcade time. I was utterly starving at that point so I left and went to the Chipotle up the street, 3 hours after I had sat down to eat at Main Event. The people who did receive their food enjoyed it despite the wait, and I do appreciate that they comped my drink (and, I guess, my pizza I forgot to remember eating).",

        "full_review": "My friend recommended Mark at 10th street tattoo. She'd recently got her first tattoo and actually went back to get another one from him a few weeks later. I'd been to one shop before coming here and I didn't have a pleasant experience so I didn't end up getting anything done. I decided to give 10th street a try since my friend had a great experience. I called Mark on a Thurs so I could talk to him and let him know what I was interested in and to see his availibility for Friday. I told him the size and words I wanted, he said it was pretty straight forward. I also mentioned to him my trip to the beach in a little over 3 weeks and he said I'd be fine. After work on Friday I drove straight to 10th street. I showed Mark the pictures on my phone of the words and symbol and showed him the placement on my body. He said it was great and he could definitely do it and it wouldn't take long...like max 15 min. That was great for me because it being my first one and not knowing what to expect-- the quicker the better lol. I felt very comfortable here. Before he started the tattoo, I was able to see exactly where it would be and how it would look to make sure it was the exact location. I decided to move it slightly. I'm glad I was able to preview it though...being that it's permanent and all. Once I got in the chair I tried to relax. He told me to let him know if I needed him to stop or anything like that but reassured me I'd be okay. I'm glad someone thought I'd be okay because I wasn't sure I was going to be lol. We talked through the whole thing which caused me to be at ease. It didn't hurt nearly as bad as I thought-- actually it didn't really hurt at all. A few times it was uncomfortable but just something you'd grit your teeth over. He was done before I knew it. I went to look at the final product and was extremely happy. It was exactly what I'd been wanting for so many years. If youre getting your first tattoo or a tattoo in general I fully recommend 10th street. They are great, everyone is nice. You can ask as many questions as you need and they'll answer them. The prices are very decent also.",

If I'm Downtown during dinnertime or lunchtime, you'll most likely find me at Samurai. The food is excellent. They offer a whole variety of authentic Japanese cuisine, some of which I rarely find at any other Japanese restaurant. For sashimi fans, they have a variety of sashimi for you to choose from. I've never had a bad experience with the sashimi I've ordered here. The meat is sliced very cleanly and prepared well. For makizushi and nigirizushi lovers, they have a wide assortment of rolls to pick from. I particularly liked their spicy salmon rolls, which definitely lived up to their namesake! As for other entrees, they offer some really great dishes. The teriyaki options are awesome. Their ramen, yakiudon and yakisoba are very delicious. My new favourite is the tonkatsu, which is sublime! The service is very good. They are quick to take your order, deliver your food, and refresh your tea. Payment is a bit of a hassle since you must line up by the cramped register area which is near the kitchen and bathrooms, but other than that I've had no problems with the service here. They can also answer any questions you have about the food which is useful when ordering things you've never tried before. I would most definitely recommend Samurai. The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is in the heart of Davie St., so during peak hours there will be quite a wait to get a seat.",

This quinoa bowl would scare anyone away from being vegetarian if it was the first vegetarian dish that they ever had. Additionally, the dish was a pretty small portion for 11 dollars worth of stale vegetables and plain chopped up tofu cubes (yuck). The weird textures and unpleasant flavours make me wonder about the other dishes on the menu. In Vancouver you generally expect way more than that monstrosity. Obviously I won't be going back here ever. The best thing (the only good thing) about my experience at this café was the server on staff who was very nice and professional.

This is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet. To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs. There's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room. The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry. We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window. We were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive. He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy. I tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful. The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well. My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad. I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was. He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things. I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed. It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there. I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it. He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site. That says a lot, if you ask me. Oh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass. Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels. Three cheers for a decent lemon martini. We were the only ones in the dining room tonight. Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret. Get thee to Comfort. And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese / gorgonzola yumminess.",

There are other spots in Portland that do individual dishes (e.g., sushi, ramen) better, but none that offer a one-stop-shop of so many types of Japanese food. They have decent sushi, but it's the other menu items that keep us coming back (it's similar to Maneki in Seattle in that way). The yakitori-style skewer options were especially good with the tsukune (ground chicken) and pork belly (technically not yakitori since it's not chicken) becoming favorites. It has a fun, lively, izakaya vibe, but the furnishings and extensive menu sometimes make it feel like a caricature of a Japanese restaurant. Early and late happy hours are good times to sample across their menu (fewer choices than their regular menu but still a lot more variety than most happy hours) Service is usually good, but can be slow when the restaurant is really busy, especially at dinner.

But the tap room downstairs had plenty of seating, and quick dual-bartender service. Some nice things to note about the tap room: 1) you can enter from the back of the restaurant where most people park, 2) if you are a smoker you can pop in and out, 3) there is plenty of bench seating for large groups, 4) this floor has it's own restrooms (clean ones), 5) you can request a table for dinner, and then hang out in the tap room until the table is available. It got a little noisy in there, but only after they started to fill up. The room is really large, and had nice lighting (and clean tables). The drinks weren't too bad. It was a strange selection for as many beers as they had. I am an IPA fan myself, but with the 20 some beers on tap, there was one IPA, and one Imperial IPA. I did a beer flight of 5 beers for $12.50. I have had cheaper flights! When I couldn't decide on a fifth beer I asked the bartender to give me a wildcard and surprise me and she gave me a \"Bucharaht\" (sp?). To me, it tasted a bit like bacon. I passed it around the table, and everyone agreed it had a nice smoked flavor. I ended up having to order a full beer of it. The bartender was not the friendliest I have ever had, hence not a five star in my book. You expect a little more personality, I guess. But I got beer, relatively fast, and was able to cash out after every order (not knowing how long we would stay). I noticed parking was a pain. We were staying in town and went on foot. I would suggest parking somewhere central and hoofing it. We also made use of Uber which worked in our favor for the night.",

Our wine glasses were never empty ( I highly recommend the house Pinot Grigio). The waiter asked me 'What type of pasta would you like?'. I asked him 'What kind do you have?'. His response? 'I said, what kind do you want? We can make it...' The food was equally as good as the service. Don't let the outside of the restaurant fool you.

The woman at the drive-thru window got snippy when I expressed the view that 15 minutes wasn't very fast for \"fast food.\" \"We fry chicken every 15 minutes,\" we were told.

I hate places that you can't make a reservation at. What I did like about Vij's is that there's a lounge you can order a drink in and wait at until a table is ready. In the lounge someone comes around every now and then with some small bites too. My drink took ages to come, by then I was seated in the main dining area. I was told it'll take 30 minutes for a table but the wait was under 20 minutes. Tried the staff meal and got half order of Marinated duck breast in mango reduction and Kalonji curry. The half order comes with a whole bowl of rice and 2 pieces of naan bread. Half order is enough for one person. Duck was delicious! No complaints. The staff meal was a total rip off. Pork was delicious but beef and chicken and vegetables were just okay. The chicken was extremely spicy. Our server told us that most their dishes aren't spicy at all but it sure was! Overall really good food and service. Wish I could choose the level of heat, make a reservation, and prices were slightly lower!",

I've never experienced service so excellent at a restaurant before. I strongly believe newbie restaurant owners should take field trips here to learn what's up. It's the little things at Uchiko. You know the food is excellent and inspiring, that's a given, but it's really the service that makes them stand out for me. They go so out of their way to make you feel like a guest, not just a customer. Whether it's the bartenders throwing in a free app while you wait for your table or just the honest and knowledgeable recommendations from your waiter. Even though we pay easily $200+ when we come here, I never feel ripped off like I do at so many restaurants around town. It is an absolutely phenomenal experience that is honestly more akin to theatre than a typical restaurant experience. Uchiko is a truly special restaurant that deserves all the hype it gets.",

What can I say that 500 other haven't said already? Not sure, but here's my 2 shiny pennies! Pops & I are of Germanic heritage. He'd been hankering for a trip to Frankenmuth MI - while I would rather have a pencil stuck in my temple. I suggested we try a trip to the German Village in C-bus and he was game for it. While the wifey is not a huge fan of german food I assured her I'd make a suitable suggestion from the menu for her. Fast forward - we're at our table (seating can be tight when busy) near the Autobahn buffet and looking over the menu - prices on everything BUT the buffet, which sort of gives me a bit of anxiety. I suggest babe order the weiner schnitzel (she likes a good tenderloin, schnitzel is the great grand father) while Pops decides a reuben is in order. Our server informs me the dinner Autobahn buffet is $15 which I leap at. (and their desserts are discouted if you order a buffet AND its $3 cheaper at lunch!!!!) Sorry you guys have to wait, I'm already heading to the buffet! Skip over the salad and straight to meat - brats, bahama mamas, mild bahama mamas, knockwurst, breaded baked chicken, warm german potato salad, red cabbage, mac n cheese and sauerkraut. Should have gotten 2 plates! I loved my Oma's cooking but I wish she'd had Schmidt's recipes - especially for the german potato salad. Best ever and I must recreate. Some say the bahama mamas are spicy. Nah. But if you love garlic, and I LOVE garlic, you must sample their knockwurst. Guaranteed to give you dragon breath tomorrow!!!! For me the standout sausage was truly the bratwurst. Absolutely friggin fantastic. And NO, I discovered a few days later ... you cannot order bratwursts delivered online. Ye Gods! Pops loved his reuben and sweetie said she was very happy with the schnitzel. [duh] So the brat was standout. But our takeaway was the vanilla cream puff. We had to have it packed to go - no way we could eat. We 3 split the next morning at our hotel - wishing we hadn't just gotten one. Not sure when I'll make it back but certainly will.",

Last time, it was the same scenario with the total lack of professionalism AND a young employee had gone outside to smoke a cigarette right in front of ht front door of the restaurant resting alongside the fence to the kid's playground where my children were playing!

        "full_review": "It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together. Our destination of choice? Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill. Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards. Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out. We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening. Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\". She took our order and left. Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient. Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly. But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable. We hit a home run with our appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. My miso soup was excellent. For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll. Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston. It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi. With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality. We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile. However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come. We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against it as he tried to cut into it. I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back. We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare. We left disappointed. The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied. I doubt we'll go back.",

We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed. If I ever had an issue with a car after purchasing it (which is rare), they are all over taking care of it like white on rice! I brag about these guys to everyone I know. They deserve it. I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota. I think, given all the cars I've had over the past few years, and the fact that I LOVE the Toyota they put me in to recently, it will be a long while before I do any car shopping. But if and when I decide to car shop again, I won't be going anywhere else but there.",

We had reservations, and though I don't think we needed them, we were seated promptly and the host was a pretty funny guy. Our server was pretty awesome too - he kept us taken care of and in drinks the whole evening. For appetizers, our friends ordered the curried mussels with a side of naan, and I, not a huge mussel fan, decided to order the hummus and naan combo. Once they brought both plates, I figured out that I don't mind mussels at all if they are coated IN THE SAUCE OF LOVE. I would bathe in this sauce if I could. Our server tried to take it away once the mussels were gone and we pretty much slapped his hand and just asked for MOAR NAAN. For dinner, we all ordered a hodge podge of food and went for it family style. The mixed grill from the tandoor was probably actually my least favorite, some of the meat was a little chewy, but saying that, it was still pretty good. The Goan Yellow Curry with shrimp was a surprise standout for me - I'm usually not that much into those coconuty flavors as I just want some spice, but it was a perfect balance. The vindaloo had good flavor, but didn't kill us. And, the saag paneer was solid. Creamy, cheesy, tasty. I'm not entirely sure how we also put desert in our faces, but we shared some rice pudding (kheer), carrot cake w/ice cream (Gajjar Halwa), and the standout for me was the little donuts in the fried sauce of peace and harmony (Gulab Jamun). All in all, a super fun night with friends, a good date night place for sure. Although, if Clay Pit had to have a tag line for me, it would be... Clay Pit: they have sauces I want to bathe in.",

So I typed eyebrow into yelp and saw the good reviews for threading here, two blocks away. I came and made an appointment for after work. Got there, friendly attentive staff, then... I meet Roju. What a fantastically unique, funny, genuine person (my first instinct was to write artist... I know) - I had never been threaded before and I honestly will not do anything else again (she made me promise I would throw out my tweezermans). I looked in the mirror and loved them, but noticed some stray hairs in the beginning of one of my brows and asked about them. She said:\"no. I'm right. You need to let that part grow in.\" I laughed and said ok, and honestly when I got home later and took a long hard look - she was totally right. You gotta respect someone so good at their craft they're willing to defy the customer because it is for their dumb customers own good! I'm glad she did.

Additionally, my other friend's Shrimp Fettuccine only had approximately five pieces of shrimp. Also, there was a paper table cover on the table but we were not supplied crayons for our pre-dinner rituals. Furthermore, my friend who is lactose intolerant received cheese on her Shrimp Fettucine. Finally, we asked for the check and received it about 6.9 minutes later. Overall, the experience was unforgettable and we made mems nonetheless. 10/10, would recommend. P.S. Beautiful toilets!",

The waitresses are really sweet and easy going, which makes the experience that much better. I've only experienced poor service here once.

This small place on Burford Highway can be very easily missed; i mean I missed it trying to get there and had to drive back again to spot it lol, anyway came here with my friend Ravi on Monday night for dinner, we can be very indecisive about our food but the server was super patient with us and luckily spoke Spanish and English like me also, made it much easier for me to explain the food to Ravi. We chose a few things on the menu to try out: empanadas de carne which were amazing, also tamales or chuchitos as they call them which I have never liked from any country or my own family for that matter and my mind wasn't changed this time either, but that doesn't mean they are not good because Ravi liked them; its just my personal taste bud. We also got pechuga a la plancha con arroz y frijoles negros which was off the chain, and lastly a quesadilla with chorizo which was also delicious. All in all we were very satisfied with our dinner that night and would love to come back to try their breakfast in the morning and any other plates they have.

We opted out of dessert over at Flemings to try the crepes here instead. Sorry to say, we were both VERY disappointed in this place and won't be coming back. I hate leaving a review like this, but I'd rather be honest about MY experience. First of all, I'm German and I know good crepes. When I walked in, we weren't even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there. He didn't have much of a personality and frankly, I thought he was a bit rude. I asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was. They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from, and he didn't even know what cafe con leche was??? We both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe. When I watched him make it, he literally \"drizzled\" a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana. Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all! The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough...it didn't have much of a taste to it either. There is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe, but guess what...they don't have ice cream. False advertising! If your going to have a picture of something on your menu, you better darn well serve it! We both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had, but we are glad we came here too. Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes. Add more of the spreadable ingredients...and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout!! They have it decorated nicely and it's very clean. The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly. I don't like giving reviews like this, but...that's what Yelp is for and maybe someone else will have a better experience than we did.",

I ordered a steak tip salad which I order a lot of from different places and this one is the worst by far, first of the tips where frozen cold which is disgusting. Second I got cooked peppers in a salad with no cucumbers, I went home and added cucumbers .... then the Italian Calzone had nothing but cheese inside, and it tasted horrible. The French fries and the fried chicken tasted like a fried Egg.... Hi hello clean the oil it's old. It was a waste of my money and if I could give it no stars I would. Lastly they wanted to over charge me and when I questioned it I got an attitude for it... we walked into all burning smoke air and it took another 10mins to get my order that they told me would be ready in 20mins. Kind you it took me 30mins to get there, I would never ever recommend this place to anyone..... it's disgusting",
